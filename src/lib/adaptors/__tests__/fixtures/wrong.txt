// Lyrics of "Broken Man" by Fox Stevenson

[Verse 1]
From the tip of my nose my head goes
Yeah, I feel it start
I got lights in my soul, shade in my heart
This ain't me but it's close
That's my favorite part
It's all good, grab a cup and get your stupid on

[Pre-Chorus]
Well the times they change
And we remain the same we always were
And if you're tired again
Ignore the pain and smile through the hurt
Oh no
It's all coming back again

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna waste your time
Just tryin' to make you understand
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work
No, I don't wanna waste your time
Just trying to make you understand
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work

[Verse 2]
Yeah hello, I'm still here
Problems up to my neck
I've got friends in my phone
But I never connect
I'm expecting no less than a bravery check
Oh, why do I pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
Well the times they change
And we remain the same we always were
And if you're tired again
Ignore the pain
It's coming back again

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna waste your time
Just tryin' to make you understand
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work
No, I don't wanna waste your time
Just tryin' to make you understand
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work

[Bridge]
And if life's just a game
I'd like to learn how to play
And if it's all the same
I'd like to do this again
And if life's just a game
I'd like to learn how to play
And if it's all the same
I'd like to try this again

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna waste your time
Just tryin' to make you understand
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work
No, I don't wanna waste your time
Just tryin' to make you understand
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work

[Outro]
And if life's just a game
I gotta learn how to play
And if it's all the same
I'd like to do this again
And if life's just a game
I gotta learn how to play
Yeah, maybe I'm a broken man
But I still work
